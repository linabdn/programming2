Web Development class April 2025

Project information:

Objective:  Design a personal/professional website which includes an interactive chat application, as the client and web designer. 

The website includes the following 3 pages:

The first page is the introduction page where you can describe briefly who you are, what you study, etc.
The second page will contain more detailed information. You can, for example, explain your professional interests, what courses you have taken, and what topics you are interested in. Alternatively, you could also describe your favourite leisure activities and achievements. For example, you could write about a hobby that is important for you.
The third page should contain a chat application, implemented using JavaScript and the Node.js platform.


## Making of the design 

I designed each page one by one with the intention of making a minimalist though colorful website.
Intention of using rem as much as possible, as opposed to my first project to ensure better responsiveness.


## Making of the home page 

It is a simple layout with a navbar with a logo and a link to the other two pages. I put a small presentation of myself with a portrait of Van Gogh rather than a picture. It was a placeholder at first but it fit very well so I left it. 
I thought the page lacked movement/animation as no scrolling is needed on large screens. Therefore I added moving flowers in the background. It wasn't too challenching (animation in css and random position with javascript)


## Making of the Info/More page 
I reused the layout of the History page of my first website. It is however very different. Each image is a png flower that inverts when hovering. The insides of each lightbox is much more elaborated. Only the concept is reused. 
I find the page has a rather original and unique look. 
Content development was rather easy and mainly based on my resume. 

noticed an issue with the scrollbar in the lightbox.
when wide screen going into smallscreen, the scrollbar has a bug: it either doesnt appear or it appears but doesn't work unless the page is refreshed. this is a small responsiveness issue i wasn't able to fix. 


## Making of the chat page

Used the given code and added styles to it. From there, I only needed to add the listening features on the javascript and add styles to them.
